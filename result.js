       text: 'Roaring Fork definitely has one of the better restaurant ambiances for sure. It\'s low-lit and quiet. A great place for a date night. As far as food comes, it\'s nice how they have various items at various prices to suit your preferences.\n\nMy girlfriend convinced me to get the chips & guacamole for an appetizer and it was actually really good! Very fresh and smooth. The cornbread for the table was also nice and buttery. For my entree, I got the Spit-Roasted Half Chicken which was delicious. It was a huge portion of chicken, almost a pound! The Corn Bread stuffing was amazing too it complimented the chicken very well. For dessert I got the Flourless Chocolate Torte which was great: very rich and dense. It was a huge portion and definitely can fill up 4 or so people.\n\nAs far as service comes it was alright. Came at 8:30 for my 8:45 PM reservation and wasn\'t seated until 9:15! I didn\'t appreciate the wait, but after bringing it to the attention of the manager she made it up to us with a free appetizer and dessert. The service from my waiter was alright, felt a bit rushed. Overall I had a pleasant experience and will come back again, hopefully with better service!',
